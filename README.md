# Name-Game
<h2>Gender Prediction using Sound</h2>

<p>The same name can be spelled out in a many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Sound can, therefore, be a better way to match names than spelling. In this project, I have used the Python package Fuzzy to find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.</p>

<p>First, using fuzzy (sound) name matching, I have searched for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration that contains names and genders of all individuals who have applied for Social Security Cards. Next, I have aggregated the author dataset by including gender. Finally, I have used the new dataset to plot the gender distribution of children's picture books authors over time.</p>
